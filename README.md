# face-authentication-system-using-FaceNet
A simple and modular Face Recognition system built using FaceNet. It generates 128-D embeddings for faces, and supports both verification (1:1) and recognition (1:N). The project includes utilities for face preprocessing, embedding storage, and a full matching pipeline based on Euclidean distance. Easy to integrate into real applications.
